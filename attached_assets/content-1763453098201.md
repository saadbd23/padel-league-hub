# Padel americano

## Americano padel is one of the easiest and most appreciated ways to organize a padel tournament. It is fun, fair, social and suitable for all levels and ages. An americano tournament is over when everyone has played with each other at least once.

# Rules of padel americano

## These are the following rules of americano

- In Americano, you compete individually but play in pairs.
- The teams change every match and the tournament is normally over when everyone has played everyone.
- Each match is played for a certain number of points. Usually 16, 24 or 32. Each team serves 2-4 times, and then the serve is handed over to the opponent.
- After all matches have been played, the player or team who has accumulated the most points throughout the tournament wins.

# How do you score in americano?

## In americano you score just like you do in a normal padel match. Instead of 15, 30, 40 and game you receive a point for each won ball.

- Each match is played for a certain number of points. Usually 16, 24 or 32. The matches can also be played for a predetermined time period of 10-20 minutes.
- Each team serves 2 times. The serve is then passed to the opponent.
- Each ball won gives one point to the winning team
- When a match is over, the score is recorded and then transferred to the individual players. If a 24 point match ends 10-14, players 1 and 2 get 10 points each. Players 3 and 4 get 14 points each.

# How to organize a Americano tournament?

## To play a padel americano, you need at least 4 participants or 3 teams.

- The number of padel courts needed depends on the number of participants. Usually 4 players per court.
- It is best if the number of lanes corresponds to the number of players. 4 players = 1 lane, 8 players = 2 lanes and so on.
- It's fine to mix levels, but if the differences are too big, consider splitting your Americano into separate groups or choosing the Mexicano padel tournament instead.
- The normal playing time for an americano is about 2 hours. A 24 point match takes about 10 minutes to play.

# Team Americano

## Americano can also be played in teams. It works just like the individual americano, but instead of being played individually, you compete in predetermined teams.
