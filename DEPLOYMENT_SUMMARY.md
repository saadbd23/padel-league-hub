## 🗄️ Database Changes

### From SQLite to PostgreSQL

**Why the change?**
- SQLite: Great for development, not for production
- PostgreSQL: Industry-standard, scalable, reliable

**Migration tools provided:**
- `init_db.py` - Create fresh database
- `migrate_to_postgres.py` - Copy existing data

**Both databases still work:**
- Local development: SQLite (default)
- Production: PostgreSQL (automatic on Render)

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Testing Phase (What You Start With)
```
Web Service:    FREE
Worker Service: FREE  
Database:       FREE (1GB)
SSL/HTTPS:      FREE (automatic)
─────────────────────
Total:          $0/month
```

**Limitations:**
- Services sleep after 15 min inactivity
- 750 hours/month runtime
- Takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- Good for 10-50 test users

### Production Phase (When You're Ready)
```
Web Service:    $7/month (Starter - no sleeping)
Worker Service: $7/month (optional - more reliable)
Database:       $7/month (optional - more storage)
SSL/HTTPS:      FREE (automatic)
─────────────────────
Total:          $7-21/month
```

**Benefits:**
- No sleeping - instant response
- Better performance
- More resources
- Handles 100s of users easily

### When to Upgrade?
- ✅ You've tested and it works
- ✅ Your friends are actively using it
- ✅ The 30-second wake-up time is annoying
- ✅ You're ready for real production use

**Don't upgrade if:**
- ❌ Still testing
- ❌ Only 5-10 users
- ❌ Wake-up time is acceptable
